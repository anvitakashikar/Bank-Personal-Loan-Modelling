# Bank-Personal-Loan-Modelling

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict whether a bank customer is likely to accept a personal loan offer. The model leverages historical customer data to make accurate predictions.

The dataset used for this project contains customer information, including demographic details, financial history, and behavioral patterns. Data preprocessing steps were applied to handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering. The data was then split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model.
Data Source for the project in from Kaggle. The link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/krantiswalke/bank-personal-loan-modelling

A variety of classification algorithms were explored, including Logistic Regression, Gradient Boasting, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbours. The optimal model was selected based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, 10 Fold Validation, and ROC-AUC.
The trained model can be deployed to a production environment, such as a web application or a cloud platform. This allows for real-time predictions on new customer data. An API can be created to integrate the model with other systems and applications.
